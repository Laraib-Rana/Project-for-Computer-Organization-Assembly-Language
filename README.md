# Project-for-Computer-Organization-Assembly-Language
This project is an implementation of the classic Pacman game using x86 Assembly Language
(TASM / DOS environment). The objective of the project is to demonstrate low-level
programming concepts such as direct hardware interaction, memory management, timing
control, graphics rendering, and artificial intelligence logic using pure assembly language.
The game closely follows the behavior of the original Pacman, including:
 Pacman movement and animation
 Ghost AI with different personalities
 Dot and power-pellet mechanics
 Score, lives, and level progression
 Increasing difficulty over time
This project highlights how complex game logic can be built even in a low-level language like
Assembly.
